# Shorts (a Twitch Clips inspired application)

This is one of my biggest projects that I have done. I have developed this using Angular and Google's BaaS service called Firebase but there's so much more to this.

This current version (v1.0.0) is the MVP of this project. There are some stuff that could be improved upon related to the user interface and user experience. Deleting and editing shorts (the uploaded videos) is too abrupt and doesn't inform the user of what happened, give the user a chance to undo their action or even ask the user for confirmation before executing the action. The "LATEST" section on the bottom of the page doesn't correctly scale/ the images

This project is being hosted live by Vercel and [you can play around with it here (v1.0.0)](https://angular-shorts-app.vercel.app/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
